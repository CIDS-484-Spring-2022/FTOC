# Freddy Takes on College (FTOC)

## Project Description
Freddy Takes on College is a 2D game about the University of Wisconsin â€” River Falls mascot (UWRF), Freddy Falcon. The goal of the game is to help Freddy with his own college experience. The user will navigate a map of the UWRF campus and complete various types of challenges. These challenges will represent different classes or areas of campus. There will be a variety of different levels each with varying difficulty. After completing all the levels, the user has completed the game, meaning Freddy has graduated from college!

## Software 
It is coded in Python with the help of various modules such as Pygame. Also, Visual Studio Code is being used as our IDE.

## Current Progress
Currently,  we are getting everything set up to start working on developing our video game. 

Also, we are working on creating a short video that will give an overview of our project, as well as, a walk through of our outline and code at a high-level.
