# Freddy Takes on College (FTOC)

## Project Description
Freddy Takes on College is a 2D platformer game about helping the University of Wisconsin â€” River Falls mascot (UWRF), Freddy Falcon. The goal of the game is to help Freddy by completing the different levels. There will be different Worlds that have their own Levels of varying difficulty. After completing all the levels, the user has completed the game, and has helped Freddy! The different Worlds will be associated with classes while the Levels will represent things like homework, exams, and projects. 

## Software 
It is coded in Python with the help of various modules such as Pygame. Also, Visual Studio Code is being used as our IDE.

## Current Progress
Currently, we are working on getting the last parts of logic out of the way so that we can make Worlds and various Levels to go with those Worlds.

## Alpha Release Features
Most of the time working was spent on trying to figure out the logic behind everything above. The next release will be a lot more polished with many Levels and different Worlds that will add some variety and excitement to the game! However these are the working features right now:

- A character that is able to move and jump with animations
- Collision detection on the character so they don't go through blocks
- A sample beginning level to show the user how to play (text to come soon!)
- The framework for a sample start menu that will be updated before the next release

## GameFiles 
The GameFiles folder contains all of the files needed to run Freddy Takes on College. This contains a subfolder called Assets which will contain all the images or sound effects that are in the game.
