# Lost in the Mountains

## Project Description
Lost in the Mountains is a 2D platformer game about helping an adventurer who took a trip to the mountains for what was supposed to be a fun vacation. However, she got lost and needs your help to escape. There are different levels with various challenges that you will have to complete. Along the way you will have to take on enemies, avoid falling in lava, and jump gaps of varying length. Once you complete all the levels, you have helped the adventurer escape the mountains! 

## Software 
It is coded in Python with the help of various modules such as Pygame. Also, Visual Studio Code is being used as our IDE.

## Current Progress
Currently, we are working on adding some more levels and other details that will add to the overall game experience.

## Alpha Release Features
This release has many working features that users will be able to see when they play the game. Below is a list of the working features:

- A character that is able to move, jump, and fall with animations
- Collision detection on the player so that they are able to interact with tiles
- 10 different levels the user can play through
- Functionality for the user to change levels upon completion of a level without going back to the level selection screen
- Functionality that handles and tracks when the user dies to either lava or enemies
- Various platforms for the user to interact with 
- A start menu where the user can see the controls and pick which level they would like to play (accessible at any time from within a level)
- Background music and a jumping sound effect
- When the user completes the last level, the user is sent to the level selection screen and the number of deaths is reset

## GameFiles 
The GameFiles folder contains all of the files needed to run Freddy Takes on College. This contains a subfolder called Assets which will contain all the images or sound effects that are in the game.
