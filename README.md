# Lost in the Mountains

## Project Description
Lost in the Mountains is a 2D platformer game about helping the adventurer who took a trip to the mountains for what was supposed to be a fun vacation. However, she got lost on a trip and needs your help to escape. There are different levels with various challenges that you will have to complete. Along the way you will have to take on enemies, avoid falling in lava, and jump gaps of varying length. Once you complete all the levels, you have helped the adventurer escape the mountains! 

## Software 
It is coded in Python with the help of various modules such as Pygame. Also, Visual Studio Code is being used as our IDE.

## Current Progress
Currently, we are working on finishing some of the last parts of the logic when it comes to lava, enemies, and moving platforms. Also, we are working on creating more levels that include these elements and the existing ones.

## Beta Release Features
Once again much of the time working is spent on figuring out logic as well as bugs that come with trying to implement new tiles and sprites. Here are a list of the working features below:

- A character that is able to move and jump with animations
- Collision detection on the character so they don't go through blocks
- 6 different levels that the user can play through
- A simple start menu that will be more polished before the final release. It allows the user to select different levels and see the controls.
- More framework for more complicated features such as lava, moving platforms, and enemies

## Alpha Release Features
Most of the time working was spent on trying to figure out the logic behind everything below. The next release will be a lot more polished with many Levels that will add some variety and excitement to the game! However these are the working features right now:

- A character that is able to move and jump with animations
- Collision detection on the character so they don't go through blocks
- A sample beginning level to show the user how to play (text to come soon!)
- The framework for a sample start menu that will be updated before the next release

## GameFiles 
The GameFiles folder contains all of the files needed to run Freddy Takes on College. This contains a subfolder called Assets which will contain all the images or sound effects that are in the game.
