# FTOC
Description of project:
  	The purpose of this project is to create a 2D game using Python and add ons such as Pygame to supplement level building. The goal is to have a fully functional map of the UWRF campus and have different levels/minigames throughout the game. Each level corresponds to a different class or part of the campus. Each level will vary in gameplay style and difficulty to make for a well rounded and challenging game. We want to have an interactive GUI that the player can use to navigate throughout the game. All documentation and code for the game will be available on our repository on GitHub (FTOC). More information about the game can be found in our outline located on GitHub

Current Progress:
    Outline created and pushed into repository. Readme file updated.
